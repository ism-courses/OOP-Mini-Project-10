Your client wants you to store classes in your **OOP Mini-Project 9** into another module.

Here are the steps:
1. Create a main.py file
2. Create a module named **classes**, and stored two classes in **OOP9_Professors.py** into the module you just created.
3. In a main.py file, create an instance of **ISMProfessor** and assign this instance to a variable named **my_ism_professor**. Call **greet_students()** method from **my_ism_professor**.
